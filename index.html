        <div id="main" class="container"> Main Story <br> </br> <br> In the heart of an enchanted forest, where sunlight filtered through the leaves like drops of liquid gold, a curious squirrel named Oliver scampered from tree to tree. His bushy tail twitched with excitement as he discovered a hidden glade adorned with vibrant flowers of every hue. The air was filled with the sweet melody of birdsong, creating a symphony that echoed through the ancient trees. Meanwhile, a gentle breeze carried the whispers of the forest, revealing tales of mystical creatures that dwelled in the shadows. As the day unfolded, Oliver embarked on a whimsical adventure, encountering magical creatures and unraveling the secrets of the enchanted realm. </br> </div>
